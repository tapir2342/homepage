    <li><b>Rewards:</b> No rewards except that you achieved something</li>

<p>If you don't want to join yet another Discord server, that's fine. I get it. :-)<br/>
In that case, just DM me your finished track and I will include it.<br/>
However, you will miss other people's progress. I will not regularly update your track.</p>

We will listen to the track submissions on a live stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/tapir2342">my twitch channel</a>. Date TBA.
