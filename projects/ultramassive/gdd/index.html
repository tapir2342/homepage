# Game Outline

## Story

Using your The One-Sheet's story outline as a starting point, flesh out your
game's story. Keep in mind that your story outline still shouldn't be more than
a few paragraphs long, but that limitation shouldn't stop you from telling the
beginning, middle, and end.

## Flow

Briefly describe the flow of the game's action in the context of the locations
the players will find themselves in. Here are some other questions that should
be answered by the game flow:

- What are the challenges players encounter and the methods by which they can overcome them?
- How does the progression/reward system work? How do players grow as the challenges increase?
- How does the gameplay tie into the story? Do players encounter puzzles that grant access to new areas when solved? Do players have to fight bosses that bar their progression?
- What is the victory condition for players? Save the universe? Kill all the enemies? Collect 100 stars? All of the above?

# Character

- What does your character look like?
- What is the character's backstory? How did she end up in this predicament?
- What is her personality type?
- How does she respond to the challenges in the game?
- How does all this information about the character relate back to gameplay?
- Does the character have any signature moves, abilities, weapons, or attacks?
- Show a basic map of the character controls (embed controller image).

# Gameplay

Start with the gameplay and detail how the sequence of play is presented.

- Are there multiple story chapters?
- Or is your game divided into levels or rounds?

# Game World

- Images and descriptions of the game world.
- List all the environments mentioned in the story. Provide short descriptions that outline what the players will find there.
- How do these locations tie into your story? What mood is being invoked in each
- world? What music will be used? How are all the locations connected within the game world as well as for the players?
- Include a simple map or flowchart diagram to show how players would navigate the world.

# Game Experience

- What's the "gestalt" / feel / vibe of the game?
- Humorous? Horrific? Thrilling? Hardcore? Foreboding? Sexy? Futuristic? Dark?
- Inspiration: DVD movie menus and packaging
- Does your gameplay use any unique interfaces? Radar?
- What do players first see when they start the game?
- What emotions/moods are meant to be invoked by your game?
- How are music and sound used to convey your game's feel?
- How do players navigate the shell of the game? Include a simple flowchart diagram showing how players would navigate this interface.

# Gameplay Mechanics

- Mechanics: Item or [game?] element that players interact with to create or aid with gameplay.
- Hazards: A mechanic that can harm or kill players but doesn't possess intelligence.
- Describe 3 mechanics/hazards.

- How do players overcome them?

## Bosses

- What environments do they appear in?

# Multiplayer and Bonus Materials

- How will achievements be awarded?
- Will it use an in-game system, or will it be supported by an external system like Xbox Live or Game Center?
- Multiplayer
	- For how many players?
	- Will multiplayer contain content that is not in the singleplayer-part of the game?
