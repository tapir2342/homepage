  <h1>ULTRAMASSIVE</h1>
    <p>
        The form of our letters, the older handwriting and inscriptions as
        much as the cuttings in use today, reflects a convention that has
        slowly solidified, an agreement hardened in many battles. Even
        after the Renaissance several European countries retained broken,
        blackletter national scripts in opposition to roman, the obligatory
        type for all Latin material; yet even today, I hope, the last word
        about Fraktur has not been spoken.

        Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of writing for
        hundreds of years. What followed were merely fashionable
        variations, here and there even deformations, of the noble basic
        form, but no improvement whatever. The punches of Claude Garamond,
        cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply unsurpassed in their clarity,
        readability and beauty. Garamond appeared on the scene at a time
        when the occidental book, as an object, cast off its medieval
        ponderousness and took up the form which today is still the best:
        the slender and upright rectangular body, comprising folded sheets
        stitched or sewn at the back, in a cover whose protruding edges
        protect the trimmed pages.
