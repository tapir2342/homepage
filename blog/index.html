			The form of our letters, the older handwriting and inscriptions as
			much as the cuttings in use today, reflects a convention that has
			slowly solidified, an agreement hardened in many battles. Even
			after the Renaissance several European countries retained broken,
			blackletter national scripts in opposition to roman, the obligatory
			type for all Latin material; yet even today, I hope, the last word
			about Fraktur has not been spoken.

			Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of writing for
			hundreds of years. What followed were merely fashionable
			variations, here and there even deformations, of the noble basic
			form, but no improvement whatever. The punches of Claude Garamond,
			cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply unsurpassed in their clarity,
			readability and beauty. Garamond appeared on the scene at a time
			when the occidental book, as an object, cast off its medieval
			ponderousness and took up the form which today is still the best:
			the slender and upright rectangular body, comprising folded sheets
			stitched or sewn at the back, in a cover whose protruding edges
			protect the trimmed pages.
