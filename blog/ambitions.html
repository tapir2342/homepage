    <p>The form of our letters, the older handwriting and
    inscriptions as much as the cuttings in use today, reflects a
    convention that has slowly solidified, an agreement hardened in
    many battles. Even after the Renaissance several European
    countries retained broken, blackletter national scripts in
    opposition to roman, the obligatory type for all Latin
    material; yet even today, I hope, the last word about Fraktur
    has not been spoken.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of
    writing for hundreds of years. What followed were merely
    fashionable variations, here and there even deformations, of
    the noble basic form, but no improvement whatever. The punches
    of Claude Garamond, cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply
    unsurpassed in their clarity, readability and beauty. Garamond
    appeared on the scene at a time when the occidental book, as an
    object, cast off its medieval ponderousness and took up the
    form which today is still the best: the slender and upright
    rectangular body, comprising folded sheets stitched or sewn at
    the back, in a cover whose protruding edges protect the trimmed
    pages.</p>
