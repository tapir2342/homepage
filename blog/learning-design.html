    <h1>Learning Design as a Hobbyist Gamedev</h1>

    <h2 class="subtitle">July 5th 2023</h2>

    <p>hi. My main goal right now is to finish my game <a href=
    "/projects/ultramassive">ULTRAMASSIVE</a>. However, I'm
    currently lacking the design skills to make it look the way I
    want. So, I gotta learn how to make it look better.</p>

    <p>The first step is to find resources for the skills I'm
    lacking. The topics will probably resolve around Visual Design
    mostly. This page will list resources that I have found and
    were helpful, or resources that might be helpful in the future.
    I'm also planning to document what I've learned along the
    journey, however this page might not be the right place for
    that.</p>

    <p>If you have any input, or recommendations, please share them
    with me on <a href=
    "https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@tapir">mastodon</a>.</p>

    <h2>Topics</h2>

    <p>The main goal is to build up a foundation by learning the
    most important principles and concepts to help me improve the
    visuals of my game.</p>

    <h3>That's why I'll mainly focus on these aspects:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Practical</i> general advice (<a href=
      "https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/">like
      this</a>),</li>

      <li>How to pair fonts,</li>

      <li>How to pick good / matching color pairs,</li>

      <li>How to design a logo,</li>

      <li>Interface Design for Games (UI).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I'm not looking for:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Design history,</li>

      <li>Designer memoirs,</li>

      <li>How the business works,</li>

      <li>How to run a studio.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Articles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/">Visual
      Design Rules You Can Safely Follow Every Time</a>: Practical
      advice, super useful!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Books</h2>

    <p>I can't actually recommend any of these, because I haven't
    read them yet. However, I am including info about why I think
    they might be helpful. Come back later to read about what I
    actually thought of these. Maybe I will have read one or two by
    then!</p><!--

      <h3>&ldquo;Logo Modernism&rdquo;</h3>

      <p>This could come in handy to design the game logo (duh :)),
      but I hope will also give me inspiration to make better UI
      elements.</p><img src="logo-modernism.png">
